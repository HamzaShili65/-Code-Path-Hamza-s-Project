## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps and Features

1. **YouTube**: 
   - *Video recommendations*: The app does a great job curating videos based on my previous viewing history and engagement. It helps me discover new content that aligns with my interests.
   - *Ability to subscribe to channels*: This allows me to keep track of content from my favorite creators and be notified when they upload new videos.

2. **WhatsApp**:
   - *End-to-end encryption*: Security is paramount and I appreciate that my conversations are private.
   - *Status feature*: The ability to share updates with my contacts that disappear after 24 hours is a fun way to keep them engaged.

3. **Spotify**:
   - *Discover Weekly Playlist*: This feature introduces me to new songs every week based on my listening habits.
   - *Ability to download songs*: Allows me to listen to music offline which is really helpful during travel or when I don't have good network connectivity.

### App Idea

**App Name**: CampusZen

**Description**: CampusZen is a dynamic, engaging, and wellness-oriented mobile application specifically designed for university students.
The application transforms the everyday university experience into an exciting real-life role-playing game, stimulating exploration and 
participation in campus activities. Simultaneously, it introduces elements of mindfulness and stress management resources to provide a 
holistic approach to student well-being. It uniquely combines the thrill of campus discovery with the serenity of mental wellness exercises,
making the campus experience not only adventurous but also balanced and healthy. CampusZen is designed to be a student's companion in their
academic journey, promoting fun-filled exploration and nurturing mental resilience amidst the challenges of university life.
